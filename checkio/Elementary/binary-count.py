#Question
# For the Robots the decimal format is inconvenient. If they need to count to "1", their computer brains want to count
# it in the binary representation of that number. You can read more about binary here.
# You are given a number (a positive integer). You should convert it to the binary format and count how many unities (1)
# are in the number spelling. For example: 5 = 0b101 contains two unities, so the answer is 2.
# Input: A number as a positive integer.
# Output: The quantity of unities in the binary form as an integer.
# Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 232

#My answer
